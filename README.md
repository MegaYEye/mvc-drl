# mvc-drl
Clean deep reinforcement learning codes based on Web MVC architecture with complete unit tests

## motivation
Implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms is easy to make up messy codes because interaction loop between an environment and an agent requires a lot of dependencies among classes.
Even deep learning requires special skills to build clean codes.

To think out of the box, Web engineers spent years on studying MVC (model-view-controller) architecture to build systems with tidy codes to handle interaction between Web and users.
Here, I found that this MVC architecture is very useful insight even for deep reinforcement learning implementation.
MVC provides a direction to an architecture with less dependencies, which would be nicer for unit testing.


## algorithms
For academic usage, we provide baseline implementations that you might need to compare.

- [x] Proximal Policy Optimization
- [x] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
- [x] Soft Actor-Critic

## Ant performance
Each point represents an average evaluation reward of 10 episodes.
Almost same performance has been achieved as a paper of [Soft Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290).

## unit testing
To gurantee code quality, all functions and classes including neural networks must have unit tests.

Following command runs all unit tests under `tests` directory.
```sh
$ ./test.sh
```
